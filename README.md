# Scientific Calculator in C

##  Project Details

This project is a **menu-driven Scientific Calculator** implemented in the **C programming language**. It allows users to perform a variety of mathematical operations through a simple command-line interface. The program repeatedly displays a menu, takes user input, performs the selected calculation, and displays the result until the user chooses to exit.

###  Features

The calculator supports the following operations:

1. Addition of two numbers
2. Subtraction of two numbers
3. Multiplication of two numbers
4. Division with division-by-zero handling
5. Modulus operation for integers
6. Square of a number
7. Cube of a number
8. Power calculation using loop-based logic
9. Square root of a non-negative number
10. Factorial of a non-negative integer
11. Exit option

###  Technologies Used

* Programming Language: **C**
* Header Files: `stdio.h`, `math.h`
* Concepts Used:

  * Functions
  * Loops
  * Conditional statements (`switch`, `if-else`)
  * User-defined functions
  * Input validation

##  Need for the Project

The primary need for this project is to:

* Strengthen **fundamental C programming concepts** such as functions, loops, and conditional logic.
* Understand how **menu-driven programs** work in real-world applications.
* Practice handling **user input errors** like division by zero or invalid choices.
* Build a foundation for more advanced applications such as scientific or engineering calculators.

This project is especially useful for **students and beginners** who want hands-on experience with structured programming in C.

##  Future Scope

The calculator can be further enhanced in the following ways:

* Add advanced scientific functions such as:

  * Trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan)
  * Logarithmic and exponential functions
* Support **floating-point power and factorial using gamma functions**.
* Implement **history tracking** of calculations.
* Improve input handling using file input or command-line arguments.
* Create a **GUI-based version** using libraries like GTK or by converting it into another language such as Python or Java.
* Optimize calculations and add overflow detection.

##  Conclusion

This Scientific Calculator project is a simple yet effective way to understand core programming concepts in C. It demonstrates how logic, user interaction, and mathematical computation come together in a practical application.

Happy Coding!
